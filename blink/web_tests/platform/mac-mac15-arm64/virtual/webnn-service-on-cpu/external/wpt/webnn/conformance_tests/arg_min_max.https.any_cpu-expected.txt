This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] [optional] argMin uint8 4D tensor, axis=1, all options
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'argMin' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint8 for argument input, must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
[FAIL] [optional] argMax uint8 4D tensor, axis=1, all options
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'argMax' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint8 for argument input, must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
