CONSOLE ERROR: Executing inline script violates the following Content Security Policy directive 'script-src 'nonce-noncynonce' 'nonce-noncy+/=' 'unsafe-inline''. Note that 'unsafe-inline' is ignored if either a hash or nonce value is present in the source list. The action has been blocked.
This tests that a valid nonce disables inline JavaScript, even if 'unsafe-inline' is present.
