  // Regression test for crbug.com/438396763, based on the repro steps in
  // crbug.com/353997473. This tests that the SoftNavigationContext created when
  // clicking on a popup window button does not leak the WindowPerformance object
  // of the popup window.
  //
  // It works as follows:
  //   1. The test creates new popup window.
  //   2. When loaded, the popup window initiates a click on its "close" button.
  //      This creates a new soft nav context.
  //   3. The button handler calls onPopupClicked, which schedules a long timeout.
  //      This will propagate the context from (2) to the callback, which keeps it
  //      alive until the callback runs.
  //   4. The button handler also creates a promise reaction which won't run until
  //      the long timeout fires, and that reaction is tied to the same soft nav
  //      context.
  //   5. Once the popup closes (pagehide), async GC is scheduled on the main
  //      page, at which point the test proceeds and checks via WeakRef if the
  //      performance object has been collected.
  //
  //      Because SoftNavigationContext needs to hold a reference to
  //      WindowPerformance in order to add performance entries,
  //      the soft nav context remaining alive due to the references from
  //      (3) or (4) or both is an opportunity for window.performance to leak.
  //      The leak will not happen if the context correctly releases such
  //      references to it once the frame it belongs to is detached.
  //
  //      In addition to the WindowPerformance leak, the detached window object
  //      itself would remain alive (via the JavaScript wrapper object for
  //      window.performance) - hence the filename of this test.
