This is a testharness.js-based test.
Found 7 FAIL, 0 TIMEOUT, 0 NOTRUN.
[FAIL] Memory interface: operation toFixedLengthBuffer()
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "toFixedLengthBuffer" missing
[FAIL] Memory interface: operation toResizableBuffer()
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "toResizableBuffer" missing
[FAIL] Memory interface: [object WebAssembly.Memory] must inherit property "toFixedLengthBuffer()" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "toFixedLengthBuffer" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Memory interface: [object WebAssembly.Memory] must inherit property "toResizableBuffer()" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "toResizableBuffer" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Exception interface object length
  assert_equals: wrong value for Exception.length expected 2 but got 1
[FAIL] Exception interface: operation getArg(unsigned long)
  assert_equals: property has wrong .length expected 1 but got 2
[FAIL] Exception interface: attribute stack
  assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "stack" expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
